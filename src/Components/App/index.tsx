        This is an experimental password generator written in ReactJS that uses a video of you to
        generate a random password. You can find more details on my <a className="text-white font-weight-bold"

        It records a short video of you and then transforms that raw video
        data into an array of 8-bit unsigned integers. Then it randomly
        selects an integer from that array and transforms it into its
        corresponding UTF-16 character. If that character is a lowercase
        letter, uppercase letter, digit or special character it will be used
        for your password. The process of selecting a random character
        continues until the password is long enough.

      description: <span>
        The video is only stored temporarily in your browser for playback
        purposes. The video will dissapear as soon as you close or refresh
        this page.

        I would strongly suggest that you do not use these passwords.
        I haven't run any proper entropy tests on the generated passwords.
        So, I can't confirm or deny the actual strength of these passwords.
        Please keep using your password manager to generate passwords.
